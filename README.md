# US_Census_Income_Data_Analytics_python
 Data Source:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income https://www.kaggle.com/dannydoeslight/uci-us-census-income-original-dataset?select=adult.data


This project was completed as an effort to understand the visual analytics with python.
I have used UCI Machine leanring Repository for the Data.
This data contains missing values and required some raw data wrangling efforts to clean the data.
Cleaned Data csv is shared in this repository.

Analytics was done to provide some unseen insights about the ethnicity,education level and marital status of the part of population
related to the annual income.
This data set contains three numerical fields and rest are categorical fields.
Sometimes for our visual analysis purpose we have used the education-num field as numerical field but it is an categorical field.
We have used Jupyter Notebook for better representation of visuals along side codes.

The code is shared and made public to use and if possible provide feedbacks.
