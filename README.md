# US_Census_Income_Data_Analytics_python
 Data wrangling and data visualization project with python. 

Data Source:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income https://www.kaggle.com/dannydoeslight/uci-us-census-income-original-dataset?select=adult.data

This project was completed as an effort to understand the visual analytics with python. I have used UCI Machine learning Repository for the Data. This data contains missing values and required some raw data wrangling efforts to clean the data. Cleaned Data CSV is shared in this repository.

Analytics was done to provide some unseen insights about the ethnicity, education level, and marital status of the part of the population related to the annual income. This data set contains three numerical fields and rest are categorical fields. Sometimes for our visual analysis purpose, we have used the education-num field as a numerical field but it is a categorical field. We have used Jupyter Notebook for a better representation of visuals alongside codes.

The code is shared and made public to use and if possible provide feedback.
